## Notes
Notes:
* Awesome, awesome job on this project. Your OOP approach is very well done and your code is very clean. I had some minor refactoring in the comments, but this is one of the strongest project 1's I've seen!
* You may want to reduce the comments a bit, but that's a stylistic choice. I agree with [this](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/) link on comments.
* Your CSS is great! I would look into increasing the size of the game board from the UX perspective.

## Things you'd like specific feedback on: 

`pointer-events` is an experimental feature in CSS and it won't officially be rolled out until CSS4!
